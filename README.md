# EmojiMyFace - Turn Photos into Emoji Art

EmojiMyFace is a web application that transforms photos into emoji art using simulated AI technology. This project is a clone of the [EmojiMyFace.com](https://emojimyface.com/) website, created for educational purposes.

## Features

- Upload photos via drag-and-drop or file selection
- Transform faces into emoji art (simulated)
- Download transformed images
- Responsive design for all devices
- Interactive UI elements

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. Upload a photo by dragging and dropping or clicking the select button
4. Wait for the transformation (simulated)
5. Download the transformed image

## Implementation Notes

This is a frontend-only implementation that simulates the AI transformation process. In a real-world application, this would connect to a backend service with actual AI capabilities for face detection and emoji transformation.

The current implementation:

- Uses HTML5 File API for file uploads
- Simulates processing with a simple canvas manipulation
- Demonstrates UI/UX patterns for a photo transformation app

## Limitations

- This is a simulation only - no actual AI face detection or transformation
- The transformation effect is a simple placeholder overlay
- All processing happens client-side

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate with actual face detection API
- Add more emoji styles and options
- Implement user accounts to save transformation history
- Add social sharing capabilities
